## How to Play

- The goal of Snake is to grow your "snake" to fill the entire screen. You do this by guiding your snake through each block of "food" that appears on the screen.
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake towards the food that randomly appears on the screen. If you accidentally run your snake into a wall or into its own body, you lose. If you manage to grow your snake to the size of the screen, you win.
