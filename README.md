Personal projects I've completed or worked on for my own development as a programmer.

## Contents

**[Virtual Wardrobe](https://github.com/JohnGeiger8/geiger-projects/tree/master/VirtualWardrobe)**
- Written in Swift, the Virtual Wardrobe, an XCode project, is an iOS application that allows users to add their clothing, jewelry, and other wardrobe items to the app.  Using the SwiftCharts library, users can also examine their shopping trends over time.

**[Minesweeper Clone](https://github.com/JohnGeiger8/geiger-projects/tree/master/Minesweeper)**
- Written in Java, the Minesweeper clone uses a simple Java Swing GUI and mimics the classic computer game Minesweeper.  It contains some simple pixel art for mines, tiles, and flags, and it has a few different difficulty levels to add some variety to it.

**[Snake Clone](https://github.com/JohnGeiger8/geiger-projects/tree/master/Snake)**
- Written in Python, the Snake clone follows the gameplay of the classic Snake game.  It uses simple artwork and the PyQt5 library to create the GUI and main game loop.

**[Job WebScraper](https://github.com/JohnGeiger8/geiger-projects/tree/master/JobWebscraper)**
- Written in Python, the Job WebScraper is a command-line web scraper that uses the BeatifulSoup and Requests libraries to scrape the LinkedIn and Indeed job sites for input job titles and locations.  It was created purely for fun and learning purposes and should not be used without viewing LinkedIn and Indeed's Terms of Service.
