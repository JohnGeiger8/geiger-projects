Personal projects I've completed or worked on for my own development as a programmer.

## Contents

**[Minesweeper Clone](https://github.com/JohnGeiger8/geiger-projects/tree/master/Minesweeper)**
- Written in Java, the Minesweeper clone uses a simple Java Swing GUI and mimics the classic computer game 
Minesweeper.  It contains some simple pixel art for mines, tiles, and flags, and it has a few different difficulty levels to
add some variety to it.

**[Snake Clone](https://github.com/JohnGeiger8/geiger-projects/tree/master/Snake)**
- Written in Python, the Snake clone follows the gameplay of the classic Snake game.  It uses simple artwork and the 
PyQt5 library to create the GUI and main game loop.

**In Progress**
- I'm currently working on a command-line web scraper that uses the BeatifulSoup and Requests libraries in Python to
scrape the Linked In and Indeed job sites for input job titles and locations.  This should be up by February 20th, 2020.
