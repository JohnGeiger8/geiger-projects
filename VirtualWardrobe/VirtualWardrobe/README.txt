Virtual Wardrobe App

Beta State:

The currently implemented features of my Virtual Wardrobe app are:
  - accessing the Wardrobe section
  - adding new items to the Wardrobe while specifying several item features, including a
    picture taken from the Photos album or by taking a photo with the camera (if available)
  - examining an item's details by tapping on it in the Wardrobe

    Using the app's currently implemented features is very straightforward.

Currently still need to implement:
  - The search bar and filtering
  - Core Data use
  - Siri implementation
  - Data trends, Wish List, Loan implementation
  - Use of Map Views for looking at item's stores of purchase
